# Userscript Proxy

Browser extensions on iOS, Android and pretty much any other web browsing device. No jailbreak/root required.

Userscript Proxy is built around [mitmproxy](mitmproxy) and acts as a MITM, injecting matching userscripts into web pages as they flow through it. Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported.


## Security

**UP can (and must be able to) read and modify all HTTP(S) traffic** sent to and from the device in question, so the only reasonably secure way to use it is to run it on a server controlled by oneself.


## Ignoring hosts

Apps like App Store and Facebook Messenger refuse to connect through a MITM proxy, so their traffic must be ignored by mitmproxy. By default, ignore rules can be specified in `ignore*.txt` files (for example `ignore.txt` and `ignore-custom.txt`).

It is also possible to run Userscript Proxy in **whitelist mode**, in which case `ignore*.txt` files have no effect. Instead, _only_ traffic matching rules specified in `intercept*.txt` files are intercepted.

Rules can be specified in two ways:

### Basic pattern

Based on the syntax used by userscript `@include` directives. Asterisk (`*`) means any string (including the empty string). `*.` is automatically prepended. `:*` is automatically appended unless the rule contains a colon (`:`).

To match a domain without matching all of its subdomains, use a regex rule instead (see below).

#### Examples

| Rule           | Matches                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `site.com`     | `site.com` and `x.site.com`                                     |
| `api.site.com` | `api.site.com` and `x.api.site.com`, but not `www.site.com`     |
| `*cdn.net`     | `cdn.net`, `fbcdn.net` and `x.fbcdn.net`, but not `cdn.net.com` |
| `site.com:80`  | `site.com:80` and `x.site.com:80`, but not `site.com:443`       |

### Regular expression

If a rule starts and ends with a slash (`/`), it is treated as a Python regex.

Note that the string to match against contains both a host and a port, e.g. `example.com:443`, and that the regex is used verbatim (i.e. you have to explicitly provide `^` etc if desired). The only exception is that the case-insensitivity flag (`?i`) is automatically added.

Also, be careful with `$`: A regex like `/site.com$/` will never match, because it will only be used to check strings like `site.com:80`.

Anything from a `#` until the end of the line is treated as a comment. Leading and trailing whitespace have no effect.

#### Examples

| Rule            | Matches                                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/cdn\./`       | `fbcdn.net`, `cdn.site.com`, `cdn.x.site.com`, but not `cdna.com` |
| `/^site\.com:/` | `site.com`, but not `x.site.com`, `mysite.com` or `site.com.net`  |


## Data usage

UP has no data usage impact when no userscript is injected, i.e. for URLs without any matching userscript.
When a script _is_ injected, **exactly one** of the following things happens:

  * The entire userscript is injected as inline JavaScript (potentially dozens or even hundreds of kilobytes).
  * A `<script>` tag referencing the userscript is injected (~100Â bytes, depending on the length of the `@downloadURL`).

A userscript is injected by reference if and only if it has a specified `@downloadURL` in its metadata.
(This can be overridden using the `--inline` flag, in which case all userscripts are injected inline.)

Userscripts are injected into _every_ response from a matching URL, and the size of a userscript can be anything from a few hundred bytes for the most basic ones to hundreds of kilobytes in extreme cases, so there are _massive_ data usage reductions to be gained from making the userscript accessible by URL and including a `@downloadURL`.
If the `@downloadURL` approach is not possible, for one reason or the other, it is a good idea to be aware of this issue, and to take appropriate action such as [minifying](minification) userscripts and adding suitable ignore rules.


## Userscript compatibility

UP supports (a subset of) the [Greasemonkey metadata syntax](metadata). No adaptation of plain JavaScript userscripts should be required. These directives are supported:

  * `@name`
  * `@version`
  * `@run-at document_(start|end|idle)`
  * `@match`
  * `@include` (basic pattern and regex)
  * `@exclude`
  * `@noframes`
  * `@downloadURL`

The [`GM` API](gm-api) and similar runtime facilities are not supported, because userscripts can only be injected as regular scripts.


## Options

### `--inline`

Always inject scripts inline (`<script>...</script>`), never linked (`<script src="..."></script>`). Useful to test new userscript features without having to re-upload the userscript and clear browser cache.

### `--port PORT`

Make mitmproxy listen to TCP port PORT. Defaults to 8080.

### `--transparent`

Run mitmproxy in [transparent mode](transparent-mode). Useful if you cannot set a proxy in the client. In such cases, you may have to route traffic from the client to the proxy at the network layer instead, making transparent mode necessary.

### `--verbose`

Inject a comment in each page specifying which userscripts (if any) were injected.

### `--whitelist`

Run Userscript Proxy in whitelist mode. Useful if you do not want to add exceptions for every single app that uses certificate pinning, but instead requires that you specify what hosts Userscript Proxy _should_ care about.
